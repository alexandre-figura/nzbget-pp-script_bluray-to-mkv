It appears that you have on-the-fly decryption software enabled. MakeMKV should process discs with most sophisticated protections without help of any 3rd party decryption software. In addition MakeMKV works faster and more reliably when it decrypts data by itself. It is highly recommended to disable such software and restart the application. 

Do you want to continue anyway (errors may follow) ?
